# Welcome to the Chainlit Project! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

This project is designed to run Langchain and Chainlit. Langchain will pull docs from Pinecone, a vector database, and will accept a query using a template through a UI in Chainlit. Langchain will interface with Chat GPT model 3.5, send it the documents it pulled, submit the query, then as for it to produce an answer based on the contents of the documents.

## To Do still.

- Utilize templates from Langchain in Chainlit methods
- Add more sample docs to Pinecone
- Utilize docs in Langchain
- Upload finished app to CloudFormation
- Research Mileverse
