Welcome to Sumanth Pisipati's IMDB AI Analysis Project.

This project is designed to run Langchain and Chainlit. Langchain will pull data about the top 10,000 reviewed movies and tv shows from IMDB, formatted by Mantium and stored on Pinecone, a vector database. It will accept a query using a template through in Chainlit. Langchain will interface with Chat GPT model 3.5, send it the data it pulled, submit the query, then ask for it to produce an answer based on the data.

Some example questions are

-What is the highest grossing movie? -What are the top 3 rated Tv Shows? -What genre is the following animation?
Future Goals

    Implement the following Chainlit functionality -Asking for clarification -Generating infographics based on data -Implement Anthropic chat responses
    Improve or experiment with other data retrieval methods -Develop context with subsequent questions
    Prompt user for API Key, to save on usage
    Research and Implement Code Llama from Meta
